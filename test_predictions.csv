140134,205637,"This game is the first game that totally left me satisfied after I played it.  This one hit the nail on the head with the fact it is  Soloable Cooperative Lovecraftian Choose your own adventure Has great art And the deckbuilding / upgrading is fantastic   I have 6x core sets, all the expansions, all the monsters from Fantasy Flight (great to use during fights to show where monsters are), most of the investigators (same as above):, terrain, and all manner of special tokens.  To say I am obsessed would be an understatement :)",8.0

17204,15158,This expansion has some edges but I like it because it forces you to change tactics when the dragon comes close to your pieces. It forces you to adapt quick or loose points. The fairy is a nice idea but we keep on forgetting that it's on the board. Uncountable points already got lost that way in our games :-( The princess gives a tool to really attack someone. The magic gates don't find a fan here ... not needed in that game I think.,8.0

188085,155426,"Fun enough to discover and tinker around with. But approaching it as a game means grinding through the numbers over and over again, with no real payoff or moment of triumph.

82907,147151,"At first I thought: it's a nice idea but not so fun in practice. It's pretty contemplative for a 'partygame'. It's more of a 'coffee game', like chess except this one doesn't bore you out of your skull. Come to think of it, maybe world did need such a game. Just don't expect something like Telestrations that will make the room roar in laughter. Play this when you'd play Scrabble. The scoring system is terrible so it's best to play without it. I think Concept is best with lower player counts, like 2-6. Replayability is great, basically infinite, as you can use your own words if you want. Of course if you play this 100 times a year you'll develop patterns and that will be boring, but let's be realistic.  2-Player Comment: * The original rules don't work for 2, but they really don't work for any other player count either. It's a good 2p game when you play it as an activity, just trying to guess each others explanations without scoring.",7.0

1175,53953,"Thunderstone is definitely a decent fantasy DBG. You get a heck of a lot of cards for the price, though I've come to find that I really don't end up playing most of them. Some of the gameplay mechanics feel unnecessary (Villagers in particular) and just don't get used by myself or my friends. Personally, I would suggest ignoring this baseset and going for one of the others, especially the Thunderstone Advanced set. They feature more refined cards and higher quality components as well.

9767,187645,Sets itself apart from War of the Ring and Horus Heresy by being half a war game and half a hidden movement (read base) deduction game. Takes about 3 hours and has a good tempo and hits most of the starwars plot points you hope to see. I like it but it is frustrating sometimes. A bit like War of the Ring one has to do effective aggression early to buffer against the late game luck as the game can boil down to guess which of two planets has the hidden base in it.,7.0

191141,65244,"Can't get over how pretty the tiles are, the gameplay is superb, fast and simplistic but always very tense.  Great family friendly coop.  UPDATE: 01/01/14  Okay, this is kind of a cheat too because I haven’t played much of the actual board game in ages.  However, it deserves a mention because I have played loads of games of it on the iPad because it plays so quickly.  I probably wouldn't break it out in ‘real life’ unless I'm introducing new players/kids – it made a great present for my 8 and 9 year old nephews for example.  I love the simplicity of the game and the theme, the artwork is absolutely beautiful, and I just think it’s really a perfect little game.  I don’t know why the Forbidden Desert theme doesn’t really do anything for me, I guess it doesn’t seem as exotic or interesting somehow – if they were movies I’d be more interested in seeing Forbidden Island than Forbidden Desert.  I guess I should give Desert a go sometime.  Maybe it’ll make another nice present for my now 9 and 10 year old nephews…  But yes, Forbidden Island will remain in the collection as a gateway game should the need ever arise to introduce somebody to gaming this way.  If it comes to game night though, I’d much rather play and get my teeth into something meatier.",7.0

186223,10630,"Fun tactical game. I enjoy it but think the sector aspect can be very frustrating, borderline annoying in some situations. You are sometimes forced to watch a third of the map crumble to the opponent and you are helpless to do anything about it. Also leads to unfinished business in some areas, which can be very frustrating. This can be particularly bad for getting/holding VP spots. Maybe I just take it too seriously.  Traded for TTR: Europe.

7673,127060,"Not my favorite Stefan Feld but certainly no slouch. Bora Bora is a very big very pretty ""too clever for its own good"" game with a lot of mechanisms crammed into one box. I think that it has some interesting things going on like a die based action drafting mechanism where you place a die on one of several Gods to trigger an associated action. Then, only dice that have lower numbers can be played on those spaces which means you can block or not block other drafts of that action. It leads to a sort of push your luck situation during play because you can want to use a given action multiple times but if you leave the god open by playing higher numbered dice on it to use the God's action than other players can use it too and possibly block you etc. the two biggest obstacles to me being able to get this to the table more are that set up time is significant due to there being so many components, and some of my game group doesn't like how much information in the game is public knowledge. They think this makes the game too front loaded and predictable. Personally, I can't keep track of all the information as it is a more than typical Feld point salad but I can understand the criticism. My personal hang up with the game is more minor in that I like so many of Feld's other games more that they out compete bora bora when I am deciding what to bring to game night. Still, I will probably be trying to bring this themeless sea horse out again soon as even a bad Feld is a good game IMO.",7.0

64908,9216,"Good resource management game. The one who is most efficient in their actions will usually win.

37567,14105,"More rules than M'44, but they seem to just make the game more dice driven.  I have no real love for the system, but I felt that at least M'44 was fast and furious and BattleCry pretty and thematic.  With C C:Ancients, I found playing with blocks made me want to play better games with blocks.   Mostly I was just annoyed with the battle back system.  Rather than pushing a front hoping to exhaust those particular cards is now gone as when you attack they battle back system gives an attack back then they have another opportunity to attack with that same flank. This becomes an extreme irritation as whittled down forces still attack at full strength.  The more I play this system the more I appreciate the battle board from Bobby Lee.   I was totally bored halfway through this, probably as a reaction to remove myself from caring about the absurd results of the dice.  On a positive note, the box is very thick.",8.0

POINTS SALAD, for sure, but an enjoyable one... though i did win, if that matters.  i loved the character-driven engine building side of the game and basically ignored the canals/esteem (or whatever it was) side of things - except for hurting others on those tracks.  but maybe i would have liked just an engine building game more?  not sure, but would be willing to play again FOR SURE, and its on my ""thinking about it"" list now, after only one play.  (PS - expect to not know anything in your first couple/3 turns.  don't even try, just jump in and try it out.  as a points salad game, i think just try out a couple things and feel out the system.

I tend to like it a bit more than Catan simply because there is less luck involved (anyone who tells you Carcassonne involves mostly luck simply doesn't know how to play it well - make good plays and it's rare you'll draw a tile that is not useful to you in some manner).  In a nutshell you are building a landscape with Roads, Cities, Fields, Abbeys, etc.  You 'claim' one of those things (if someone has not already) with a game piece (a 'meeple') of which you have seven.  Once someone has claimed the start of one of the individual structures building on to it and completing it will provide you points.  When you complete one you get the 'meeple' back that was on it in order to play it on a new construction.  The base game is very simple and easy to learn, but mastering it will make you really pay attention to the board.  There are many expansions to this game, so I would suggest buying the base game and the ""River II"" to start with, then read up on the expansions and add in the ones that look appealing to you.

Then there's the huge amount of work you have to do to catch up on this game buying data packs and learning what kind of cards and combinations come out. I can't stand games that involve building custom decks, because then half the game isn't the game, it's preparing the materials you use to make the game. Games like Imperial Settlers are at first fine because it's all preconstructed decks, but then fall apart when you're expected to custom build your own decks for a 'better' experience. I don't want to build my best experience. I'm PAYING YOU TO DO THAT GAME! This can be a huge problem in social games like the werewolf games, and especially when you oversaturate with roles, like in Two Rooms and a Boom.   I'm also not a big fan of a game that revolves around building these custom card interactions, but then you're still stuck with the process of drawing cards, and hoping for the best. While in game design I think that a deck of cards can be a nice randomness generator, I don't think that everything is best represented using this. In a game where you're a future-hacker, why would your stuff be randomly generated? I'd rather have there be a pool of cards that you're working from, and then have that be what you're customizing (but then you're halfway to Dominion, which features the same problems where there are certain intrinsically positively valued plays). So I haven't nailed down the problem of Netrunner in a coherent central hypothesis, but at least now I know for sure that it is what it is.  tldr: I hate LCG's but this is probably the finest LCG out there.",7.0

105373,36218,"Dominion is a fairly simple engine-building game, conceptually. Your engine is your deck, which you move through at a semi-fixed rate, picking up five cards per turn and reshuffling when you run out. Certain cards move you through your deck faster, or cause your opponents to move through their deck slower. At a certain point, you switch to acquiring victory points. Whoopie.  The interesting bit is the variable setup. You pick 10 cards from an ever-increasing number, then stare at them for a bit. But that stare hides a lot.  Some setups are obvious and less interesting; get money +one or two action cards. But ~70% of the time, wheels start turning and you're faced with some options. Usually, you pick up trashing first; get rid of the crap  cards from your deck, move through it faster. But sometimes there isn't trashing, or there are attacks that you have a priority to get. Sometimes games are long and drawn out with lots of crap and lots of micro-decisions about how to manage it. Sometimes you'll completely wreck an opponent's deck, and he'll concede.  ""But wouldn't you rather have a game that does that, but in a more focused way?"" Sometimes. But sometimes you and your opponent disagree on the paths, and you get interesting stuff, tweaking your way through the forest. Sometimes you need to grab his power cards, or take a sharp turn into ending the game before the behemoth he's attempting to assemble takes off. And that's interesting, and that's something you don't get without variable setups. Playing a fluctuating herbalist-philosopher's stone against an ambassadoring opponent with an engine was a really interesting game.  So why do I only rate it a 6? Well, I've played mostly on isotropic (I've played >20 games in person, but >300 games online.) Without the online interface, players move slowly, and the game overstays its welcome. A dominion game that lasts 15 minutes is a lot of fun; one that lasts an hour and a half verges on torture.  There's also the problematic bit with variable setups: sometimes they're not all that interesting. And while Cosmic Encounter and the like have player interaction to steer the game in interesting directions, Dominion really doesn't have anything to fall back on.  Luck? That's an issue too, although not an extreme one. In interesting setups, skill probably makes up %60 of the outcome, and the better player wins ~80% of the time (good players get lucky, too). In less interesting setups? The good player can eke out percentagewise advantages, but that's really not that interesting.  An interesting variant I sometimes enjoy is Progminion; find an interesting set and build a robot to play it. This is a lot more interesting than it sounds.  All in all, it's a 6; I'll play it sporadically. I'd play more if it were on a good online implementation. It was an important part of getting me interested in designer games (I was pointed to it from an MTG site). It's fun. But it's not the greatest game around.",7.0

52454,121921,"First attempt and my brain exploded at confusing rulebook.  There's gotta be a better way to explain this game.  Seriously, somebody please find a way.  I had to rewatch gameplay videos to understand the game flow and know what my options were at each phase, and all the tiny rules.  Did a lot wrong on my first solo attempt.  Lost.  Kept trying to reroll weather dice to see if it was just dice hating me, but nope.  The game pretty much beat the snot out of me for 5 months in a row.  2nd Attempt, after watching the gameplay videos, much better.  I did a lot wrong on my first play.  This time I succeeded by October pretty comfortably.  The story really shined this time around...probably because I wasn't reeling so much from being beaten incessantly over the head with unfortunate events and had a little time to enjoy the journey.  The experience of this 2nd attempt is enough to make this game a keeper.  Can't wait to try other scenarios.  UPDATE: I've played Castaways and Cursed Island a few times now, 1p and 2p.  I'm STILL finding new ways that I've been playing this game incorrectly.  I appreciate that a game system in which alternate scenarios can be applied, that dynamically change the game's story is a major achievement in game design, but it's just a lot to keep track of with these finicky rules.  Overall, though, I think it's a winner and I'm willing to put up with the fussy rules and needing to read FAQs and quick start guides looking for clues about how to interpret certain situations.  UPDATE: Up to this point we had been hunting completely wrong.  It took 7 plays for us to finally play the game 100% correctly.  We beat the Cursed Island scenario 2p and on our 8th play, 3p, we beat the Castaways scenario.  The game is running smoothly now, and by that I mean I run the machine of the game and encourage everyone to do their best to stay tied into the story being told.  There's a lot of moving parts, and at times it feels like I'm the only one who knows how to keep the game together, but overall it tells a really compelling narrative and even my teenage nieces had fun with it on their first play.  After we won I explained all the other scenarios we can act out and their interest spiked even more.  I think I need to explain this game as if we're acting out a story.  People who approach it thinking we're playing a ""game"" might have the wrong idea.  It's hard work trying to survive on a cursed island.    UPDATE: my wife and I have been playing.  We're stuck on Saving Jenny.   Poor Jenny.  Poor, poor Jenny.  UPDATE: played my first 4p games... died twice.  So much harder with more people.  Tried it twice and failed.  Came home and tried it by myself playing as 4p + dog + Friday and I completed the Castaways Scenario at the beginning of Round 11.  The roof is your friend.  UPDATE: played 4p again and lost miserably. SO much harder.  Agh!  UPDATE: 3p is perfect.",8.0

Negative comments:  Too finicky,  puzzles not hard enough,  didn't get to do enough in the game, needs an organizer for the components, daunting rulebook if never played this type of game before.  I seemed to be the only one who objected to the downtime between turns.  The time I got to play compared to the length of this 2-3 hour game, was a very small ratio.  I didn't care about the story line, which held the interest for others.

I glued the figures to the bases and after play switched the baggies for organizing containers for the many components.

Twilight Imperium is amazing in scope, but the game hasn't aged all that well. It's too long, there's too much down time and all too often the game's action only involves two or three players when it is all said and done. If they could streamline this stuff, I was more than happy to bring this style game back to my tabletop.  Ironically, I think they took out too much. The card battle system is interesting, but it's also tedious. It also rewards card counting, which I understand is considered to be a feature by many, but I think it robs the battles of tension when the outcome is already known before the card is flipped.  Also, only including four races is laughable. There should have been at least eight in this box, to keep it interesting. Especially when you consider each race is somewhat pre-programmed via their unique unit selection to behave in a fixed way, when pursuing victory.  I'm also getting burnt out on Fantasy Flights obsession with printing tokens and cards with no words on them. Draw a card from the fate deck. Which one is that, none of them say FATE on them. Flip a token. It's a tiny picture of a desert, a swamp...or a plate of bacon. I really can't tell. I guess we'll have to look it up AGAIN.

145746,103885,"The games always devolve into ships just running into each other and moving around each other blindly, and victory comes down to pure luck of the dice. Watching some of the tournament games online confirms that this even happens with more experienced players. The luck of the dice can't really be mitigated, so it's not uncommon to roll four or five dice to try to get that last hit on your opponent, then watch as you roll poorly and they avoid any damage. This has to do with the even dice distribution. You're as likely to roll a hit as your opponent is to roll an evade. I like the Summoner Wars approach better where the attacker is more likely to roll a success, so it keeps the game length down and those big dice rolls are more reliable. The game also drags on for way too long because of this. I haven't actually finished a full game because we usually call it quits after just one or two ships get destroyed and well over an hour has passed.  All of that aside, I like a couple of things about the game. The variety, especially with a few expansions, is really high. For each ship, you've got several different pilots who all work a little differently, plus lots of different upgrades to choose from each game. Another big selling point is the simplicity, once you get past a few fiddly rules involving ship collision and obstacles. You just program your moves, move your ships, attack, and repeat.

All aspects of your civilization must be balanced - you need science, food, resources, military, happy faces, actions, good leaders and wonders, etc... But you simply don't have time to do everything.  The game is tense and requires a lot of strategy. Most of the time you aren't doing well, it is because of something you did(or didn't do) several turns ago. But the game also requires you to adapt to which cards show up in which order. You have to make choices about whether to upgrade your farms now, or wait a few turns and maybe try to get a farm from a later age. You also have to adapt to what the other players are doing.  Overall, an excellent game. It's fun to build up your civilization, and if you play well, finally get an engine going that could win you the game.",8.0

I think that you're usually supposed to draft cards from packs which are guaranteed to be somewhat balanced. That's not what this was... it was random cards from random sets and it was not even remotely balanced. About half the cards that I saw were black, which isn't what I think you'd normally see.  So... having never played the game before, I think a two minute rules explanation was probably not enough preparation for the draft. I had no clue what I was doing during the draft and/or deck construction. Luckily they put me up against another person who had just learned the game. Even so, I still got my butt handed to me two out of three times.  I get the feeling that the main fun here is probably the drafting phase, where you're making interesting choices about how to build your deck.

Aside from that, the game sets familiar problems of optimising the placement of tiles in a grid.  Kingdomino is by no means a brain burner, but nor is it utterly trivial.  I agree with those who say it should be played either four- or two-player advanced so that all the tiles are in play, significantly reducing the luck of the draw.  Production quality is very good.

2605,9609,"Rated on the basis of one very long game. I enjoyed it a lot, and the thought and effort that went into balancing it yielded good results: when I played, I was Sauron and my friend was on *the last space* of the Crack of Doom when I managed to increase his corruption enough to win. The entire game came down to a roll of the die: 1-3, he won, 4-6 I did. I rolled a 6. Insane! And also a little annoying. It made me feel like I could've flipped a coin and saved myself eight hours. But then again, the production value is so high that the game was well worth it. Unlike a lot of more schematic Tolkien games, you aren't following the story exactly, but creating the War of the Ring as you go. The game leans toward conquest of Rohan and Gondor, but they aren't necessary, and there are plenty of ways the Eye can win by, for example, attacking to the north, or by sitting back, not mustering much at all, and hunting for the Ring. The range of choices you have per turn is satisfying, and the action dice introduce enough randomness that you will always get PART of what you want to do, but rarely will you get the exact results that you need. I really like this game, and I'm curious to see over the next few plays how much strategy has to do with the outcome. [ETA: Played again, this time as Free Peoples; got trounced. So much for too much balance!]  Yet another update. I'm rerating this from 9 to 7 just because I've played it so much I'm sick to death of it. I still think it's phenomenally well balanced and designed, but there are a fair number of fiddly rules to keep track of and a lot of winning strategies. The trick is to figure out which route your opponent is going to take, and optimize your own strategy to take advantage. Is Sauron sending all his Nazgul to Minas Tirith? Then start moving Frodo and the gang. Is Saruman in the game early? Then get Aragorn or Gandalf down to Rohan and try to hold the line, getting the Shadow to spend dice. So much of the game is a defensive maneuver for the Free Peoples.

173214,15364,"This is an engaging economic game where players bid up contracts to improve their casinos, adding slots, game tables, betting rooms, five-star restaurants, and more. One of the particularly satisfying things about this game is that you must balance your floor traffic against your potential revenue. Some attractions bring in more customers, and some allow them to spend more money. Your income at the start of your turn is always the lowest of the two, so you have to plan your expansions carefully. Much like Princes of Florence you must manage your casino's physical layout (although in this game you have limited options for ""renovating"" your casino and changing the layout).  Vegas Showdown features a Puerto Rico-like mechanic where tiles not taken (or in this case, bid on) become more attractive the following turn (the minimum bid degrades from turn to turn, unlike Power Grid or Scepter of Zavandor where the minimum bid is fixed). I found this added a lot of excitement to the game, because it's possible to grab buildings ""for a steal"" or to pay huge sums of money, and both can be good moves. I also like that the game caps bidding (the caps are fairly high), so that near the endgame players have to consider the possibility of being shut out by the turn order (first player can plunk down the max bid, ending the auction immediately). Finally, Vegas Showdown features an end-game condition similar to Stone Age, where there are three stacks of high-end casino improvements dwindling at different rates. Here, however, those rates are randomly determined by cards that flip up each turn, and not by the players.  I think the cards will make the odd game of this feel more random than it ought to be (persistently rewarding one player or punishing another, seemingly regardless of planning), but that's unusual and really not an issue.   Update: I've cooled a bit on Vegas Showdown as my gaming experience has deepened, but even so I find it hard to fault the game. It is a very solid offering for newer gamers, or perhaps all but the most experienced / hardcore gamers. For me I don't feel like the game involves much in the way of problem-solving or creative maneuvering. A straightforward, well-made game of snowballing and optimizing. Given the time-frame and style of auction, Homesteaders may obsolete this. ",8.0

Only 3 of those cards will be played down in the action rounds but the other 2 may be used if someone else plays them down. The cards each allow you to do two things, you get to do both if you're the only one that plays down that card, otherwise you choose one of the actions on the card. I always enjoy this element of group think.   Actions are used to purchase buildings. You're trying to build a goods producing engine on your individual playing board that will ultimately generate VPs. After 4 rounds of playing actions the game is over.  Also to mention is an interesting goods wheel that you have to see to understand. If the wheel is empty on the 0 space of the wheel you turn it clockwise and it produces the more advanced goods that are needed to purchase many of the buildings. There's a balance in how you use this wheel to your advantage that I think is the key to game.",7.0

It did have this appearance, but certainly it isn't the case. I do think that some understanding of the game's mechanics are necessary to play it well with any of the factions. Although it's hard to play well when it is your first time (easiest with Khorne though), it is a game that encourages you to play multiple times and learn the different strategies that are available. Overall, a good mix of card play, dice battles and unique player skills and goals. A little clunky for the first time, but turns move relatively quickly. Not having a minimum knowledge of the factions does make for a somewhat chaotic game.",7.0

Doing each phase in turn order keeps everyone involved, no waiting through stretched out player turns. Definitely mid-light euro, plays in 60-90mins.  The theme and graphics are lovely, and everything ties in nicely - what you are doing generally makes sense given the theme. The sizing of the cubes proportional to value is a nice touch.  ",7.0

The amount of characters you can play the amount of things that can happen in a card.

Played as: 5 player  Pros: Very intuitive game rules-wise while still offering some variability in which scoring tiles are used and offering some gut wrenching choices when pricing the tiles in your market.  Cons: Those gut-wrenching choices when pricing your tiles can slow things down. Also, each round ends in scoring a mini point-salad (more so in later rounds) which seems to take a fair chunk of the game's playing time. I'm probably overstating those two time sinks in the grand scheme of this not being that long of a game, but I'd say 2/3 of the play time is on those two parts of the game. I was really excited going into the game about the tile laying aspect, but found the interesting aspects of that mechanic neutered leaving nothing more then a somewhat obvious jigsaw puzzle. And for some reason, I never got that end of game sense of ""look what I built!""  Other: Reading the above, would make someone think I didn't like the game all that much, but it really is nice. It's probably a result of delivering a product, not necessarily worse, but different then my expectations. It's really a very solid piecing together of established designs. I expect I might like the game more with fewer players (only played with the max 5 players) as scoring and surveying a smaller market would reduce those more drawn out element of the game.

A twenty-five page rulebook which explains seven phases of every turn shouldn't play so smoothly!  Or create such an immersive experience.

A  wonderful game.  :)   Edited 2-19-13--------  I left the game for about a year.  I wasn't able to defeat the second scenario and became a bit frustrated.  I wasn't angry with the game, I just realized that I would have to start deck-building to progress and I didn't want to do that at the time.    I never did a deck-build in my gaming life and it intimidated me.  A month and a half ago, I went back to it after delving into the LotR:LCG forums in addition to watching videos.  I began to deck-build then fell in love.  This is the finest game I've ever played by a wide margin.  It's amazing how much this game consumes my thoughts.  I love the theme, the quick set-up, the game mechanics, the brain-burn, the sense of accomplishment I feel when I beat a scenario, the knowledge that new adventures will continue to come out, adding to my pleasure.  I have recently bought every expansion to date.  It wasn't cheap, but I know this will engage me for years.  Solo play or with others, it delivers an extremely immersive experience.  Negatives for the game are mere quibbles.  I will warn you that this game isn't easy, but it is beatable.

Nearly four years later I was able to give it another go, and instantly decided that that was much too generous. In fact, I doubt Transamerica even qualifies as a game for grownups to be rated. There is no decision to be made whatsoever save for your initial starting position, and after that it's just guesstimating until someone connects all of his target cities. Now here's a poser for you: the rules are all perfectly fine, there is nothing which breaks them. But neither do they form a interesting set which rewards clever play. How do I rate the game? How do you rate the 'game' of throwing a lot of dice and then deciding the winner on the total...?   Now as a children's game, if the grid were made a little coarser for the truly young ones...

Fog of war is also nicely executed with the corporation player playing his defenses face down. Figuring out the best combos from your cards is fun as well.  After a few plays the bad stuff kicks in, though. It is extremely boring to play the corporation. You are basically just sitting there waiting for the runner player to attack or waiting for the scoring cards to appear. I guess it says enough if you use the word ""wait"" twice in a sentence. Moreover, the rulebook is as bad as you can expect from Fantasy Flight Games. It is absolutely useless if you are trying to find some important rules. All rules having a big impact on the game play (the maximum Memory Units the Runner has at his disposal, for example) should be at least bolded or made stand out from the rest of the text. But no. Now everything is scattered all over the rulebook and some rules cannot be even found under the title explicitly referring to them making it impossible to find the piece of information you need quickly.

38185,176494,"Several comments place this game as a ""classic"" or ""advanced Carcassonne"". I find neither of those comments to reflect Isle of Skye. Like Carcassonne, IoS is a tile- laying game where one tries to construct a map of elements which optimizes scoring. While the core auction mechanism itself is not unique, how the mechanism is put together, is. The ability to purchase tiles from opponents, while pricing your own set of tiles with the intention of either selling it for profit or making it prohibitively expensive for others to purchase is a mind-bending exercise. The ability to select and discard a single tile from your individual pool also adds to the complexity of the decision-making tree.     I consider all these ""variables"" to be both a strength and weakness of the game.  Some variables can be ""adequately predicted"" or at least partially ""corralled"" to help make good decisions. With blind, fixed auctions, that ability is somewhat harder to contain. While you may plan to obtain a certain tile, certain events such as player order or pricing will hamper your carefully laid plans. While you can determine your own pricing of tiles, it is also tough to gauge how opponents may react to your pricing. Also, different players, newbies, veterans or casual gamers often have a different way of gauging ""value"" of tiles. What one considers reasonable may be too pricey for others.      Auctions as a mechanism in gaming can be a wonderful tool to calibrate value of resources in a game. But, for some games, auctions can be an easy way for designers to let players determine their own pricing. It doesn't always work for all games particularly if there are multiple variables intertwined within the auction mechanism. It is much harder to judge value when too many factors, whether subtle or direct, come into play. This is one issue players face in IoS: Which tile to discard? which tiles I want to sell? which tiles do I want to keep? what other tiles people may want? which tiles may be priced out of my reach? What tiles may still be available on my turn? What elements are more valuable for me? Can the tiles be oriented correctly on my map? etc. The variables are numerous and even then, with all the planning, the tile may no longer be available for pickup when your turn comes along.      Isle of Skye is not a bad game. In fact, I enjoyed it. I find the pace and length of the game to be just right. It's just that I am not sure I can ever find a way to be good at the game. That said, this game requires newbies to play a few games before having a good handle on the value of tiles.

Combined with Khorne's dial being one kill per territory you can easily get one dial advancement counter one turn and five the next with the exact same setup.

I'd love this game to be diceless but it would require a separate combat deck or something with major reworkings.   update: I think I've come to terms with the dice but I'm still not fond of the exploding on 6s thing as it can get kind of swingy. I like the threat of more kills than the number of dice because it keeps the planning from getting too finely tuned, but I would like it better  if it were limited in some way.   probably final update, as I haven't played in years: Chaos seemed brilliant when I was first starting to get into boardgaming as a serious hobby. It showed me the light. I still love the theme but my opinion has dropped from great to merely good and my enthusiasm for play has diminished accordingly. If someone wanted to play Chaos I would do so, though I would rather not play Khorne since so many of his decisions are rote. As it stands I would not request a play except perhaps in a rare fit of nostalgia. I have too many games with the same amount of interaction but with less rough edges and balance issues. Plus, I have a friend with a small stack of COIN games which fill an identical niche.",7.0

I didn't care the for the mancala element; I'm not crazy about mancala in the first place, and here it just felt like a rondel on which you play a separate mini-game.  ------------------------  Alternative version for those who prefer more snark:  --In Trajan you are playing mancala . . . and a few other similarly abstract games at the same time.  --Well, why don't we just break out the GIPF series and do that thing with the potentials where you can play the games all together?  --Because it would be really thinky and we don't like abstracts that much.

118003,161970,"Alchemists is a competitive deduction game in which players are trying to figure out the composition of various alchemical elements based on the effects they produce when mixed together. The game uses a mobile app to randomize the setup and administrate the game (alternatively, a non-playing person can do this). Combined elements (called “potions”) can be tested on students (who may charge you), yourself (which may have very adverse effects), or customers (who cost more action points and may either give you money or cost you points). Either way, the resultant potion will have a color and a sign, which can be marked in your screen. Once you have enough information about a given element, you can choose to publish your findings for victory points. There are incentives to publish before your information is complete, but if you’re wrong then other players can choose to debunk your research which gives them points and costs you points. On top of this game lies an action selection system that’s very reminiscent of Dungeon Lords or Dungeon Petz. I enjoyed the deduction elements of this game, but some of the chrome didn’t sit well with me--the publishing system had a “get there first” kind of feel, and action selection mechanism seemed a little overwrought and fiddly.

111316,176494,"Even though it is not an entirely new mechanism, the pricing of tiles is what differentiates Isle of Skye from most of its tile-laying brethren. Each turn players need to set prices for the tiles they draw, and the other players get first choice of a tile to buy. Tiles that do not get chosen have to be bought by the player who set the price.  In theory, this could lead to players setting prices individually according to current circumstances and special needs of certain players. That would probably significantly increase play time, however. In practice, many of the tiles are quite similar, and since there is a steady influx of money into the game, over time all tiles generally become more expensive with (relatively) minor differences depending on the scoring conditions in this particular game. And similarly, you typically don't want other players to buy your tiles at all because in many situations more tiles is better and you can acquire at most one per turn.",7.0

I'm one of the few who actually like Eagle Games' old translation of the computer game franchise, and was eagerly looking forward to FFG's take on it.  I had the box lying around gathering dust for about a year, while trying to get it played at least three times. For some reason, the rule book killed my enthusiasm every time. I don't abhor rules, generally - I like a meaty, complex game - but something about these 30 pages of not very exceptional instructions just put me off, and convinced me to pick up another title instead.  The fourth time, I almost didn't read it through (again). Setup was slightly confusing, as rules are cross referenced from paragraph to paragraph, and you have to scrutinize the rather small image of how the board is supposed to look like rather closely to get all the pieces in the right places.  Likewise, the first turn or two was chaos. Battle incomprehensible, in its simplicity, and resource management baffling. Then, something clicked and the game took off!  This is exactly the kind of game I like. Multiple victory conditions, lots of important choices both short term and in the long run - you don't have the time to do everything you'd like (a plus, in my book), and even though it seems you have to follow one singular strategy to win you have to keep investing at least a little something in the other victory avenues too - to keep pressure on other players who are pursuing them.  Summa summarum: For some reason, this game has a steeper learning curve than it should, for a relatively simple game. Once you get into it, it's easy to play, with great depth, variety and replay value.",7.0

70909,126042,"Moving card display, resource acquisition and payment, population usage and management, buildings, wonders, colonies, all of these facets can equally apply to Nations and Through the Ages. I would venture to say Nations wouldn't exist without Vlaada's ground-breaking work on TtA. While it is clearly derivative, Nations offers a completely different play experience than TtA.  Nations simplifies the game by reducing the dependencies and interactions between cards and removing or streamlining all of the penalties for high production and population growth. Also, there is no concept of ""government"" in Nations and government might be THE defining feature of any empire. As a result, Nations lacks the feeling of political struggle and incremental growth that TtA captures really well. In Nations, much of this boils down to ""what do I need more or less of next turn? let me adjust"". That's not the say the game isn't fun or interesting, it's just different. Nations is about acquiring cards that you need and then populating and using them to manage your growth effectively. Nations feels more like an optimization exercise of upgrading cards and shifting resources. In what it does do, it is one of the better mid-weight euros I've played this year.   Happy to own this and enjoy it when I want a mid-weight euro. While similar in many ways to TtA, they aren't even trying to do the same thing.",8.0

171712,122515,"One of only two Breese ""Key"" games I've played.  This is a very good and very deep game.  There are a lot of moving parts, which I love, and some pretty original elements.  The game is a pseudo-worker placement game with a pretty prevalent bidding mechanic and home area city building.  Like I said, there are a lot of moving parts.  Each game round is a season and each season tiles are placed out for players to use and bid for.  The first of the unique mechanics in this game is each player bids with meeples and the meeples are in 4 different colors.  Bidding on a tile has to be done in the same color, so if I bid 2 blue meeples, you have to bid 3 blue meeples in order to outbid me.  Also, only 3 of the colors are easily available.  The fourth color, green, is in shorter supply and only granted when using certain tiles and therefore gives a player more bidding power.  The use of these tiles is also pretty original.  Instead of bidding for a tile or after the tile is placed in a player's home area you can place meeples directly on it to use its effect.  Using a tile also has to be done with the same color meeples as used to bid on the tile or use it previously.  And the owner of that tile (or winner of the bid) gets to keep any meeples on it for use in later rounds.  I was thoroughly impressed by how deep and original this game was and at the convention in which I played this I was ready to jump up and buy a copy halfway through.  The end game scoring scared me off though.  There was already almost too much complexity for me to think I could introduce it to my more casual game group but I enjoyed it so much I was hoping I could make it work.  But the end game scoring brought a lot more complexity to the table that just pushed it over the edge.

171712,183394,"This is probably one of the highest regarded games I had yet to play until recently.  At least out of ones that I am interested in playing.  It was fine.  I like worker placement games quite a bit, probably my favorite game mechanic.  This is a worker placement game about running a vineyard.  Each game round runs through all four seasons and each season players do different things.  During the spring you decide player order by which time you get up.  Earlier you get up earlier you go in future seasons, later you get up the better ""happiness"" benefits you get.  This has been done before, one of the most memorable is the  game Fresco.  During summer you play simple worker placement.  During fall each player draws either a summer or winter visitor card, these cards are very powerful and allow you to use their abilities using a specific action space during their designated season.  Finally winter is another basic worker placement but uses different spaces than the summer worker placement.  This is a game about efficiency.  The main way to gain points is to fulfill wine orders and that is a multi-step process that everyone has to follow.  You draw and plant vines, you harvest grapes from those vines, and you turn those grapes into wine.  There are different ways to go about this process.  You can build buildings that make this more efficient or use visitor cards to do these things more efficiently, etc.  But for the most part you're trying to do it better than everyone else and the game is a race to 20 points.  I found it fine, like I said.  I think the sweet spot for this game is 3 players.  With 3 players there are 2 action spots per action, so there is some competition for highly sought after spaces but not so much it can feel crowded and frustrating.  After 3 players it starts to feel very crowded.  With 4 there are still only 2 action spaces with another player and their pieces fighting for those spaces.  With 5 there are 3 action spaces and yet another player.  6 seems abysmal with 6 players fighting over 3 action spaces per action.  I also think any game that is essentially a race needs to have a balancing mechanism for starting player order.  Yes, you do choose your player order during during the spring but you choose that player order in a different player order so it's not quite as balanced as it should be.  I think that balance would get closer to disappearing in a 3 player game with less competition and crowding during the worker placement pieces.  It is also a very pretty and well built game.  Lots of different shaped wooden meeples for your workers and different buildings.  And soft pastel art for most of the cards and boards.  I even like how the field cards line up with the art on the vineyard board.  Simple thing but it looks and feels nice.",7.0

Place your pauwns down in the village and when the lava starts flowing, get as many as you can out as possible.

I have introduced it to co-workers and my gaming group with excellent results.  My 9 year old daughter enjoys playing this game.  My 7 year old is a bit reluctant to play.  But, this is a game even my wife enjoys on occassion.  The bits are fine.  I did replace the cloth bag with a larger one.  The placement of the pieces can be a bit tricky because the board is not groved at all.  But all that is very minor and does not detract from game play.  Plays just as well with 2, 3, 4 or teams.

I'm not convinced either that the game has been created yet which is the best vehicle for this game engine (Thunderstone is still not it for me).

Unfortunately, they suck all of the strategy and interest out of the game and turn it into a completely random affair with the silly passing around of cards.  What on earth made them think that was a good idea?   How are you supposed to use incremental information gained if the location of the information is moving around every 2 seconds in a hidden manner?   Perhaps there are some SUBTLE strategies in determining the probabilities of what people may have, but a lack of certainty makes forming chains of deductions completely useless.     We played in a 6 player game where you ended up having NO hidden cards, so perhaps the game works a little better with 3-4 players when you can hide information.  They could have had a brilliant game on their hands, but instead ruined it with a bonehead design decision.   Makes me sad.  Oh, and what is with having to return to the hall every 3 turns?

36874,128621,"The components are very nice, with many different wooden pieces, thick cardboard, nice design with double sided board for learning, etc. The rules are easy and even if it's a worker placement eurom they fall into the theme; while I was playing, I did see myself making wine, but I have to admit that there are a few concesions to the abstraction of the mechanisms.  Those said mechanisms are nothing new, it tales Fresco's wake up chart and divides the woker placement in 2 phases: the workers you place in summer won't be avilable in winter. Everything fits together quite well and the gameplay it creates is very fluid. There are no evident paths to victory: even if there's mainly one thing you need to do to score points, you can get to in in a variety of ways. The game seems balanced, but I still think it should have been worked a bit more to include other options and and rework the cards that give points in order to really offer more diverse strategies.  The time between turns doesn't feel long because the gameplay is fast, but you cannot use this time to think, because the decissions are not difficult. Because of that, I think 5-6 players games won't work well.  The interaction is light: you just compete for worker placement slots and each player has an uberwoker than can be placed in closed spots. Even though, the competitions of spots in the last turns is almost cutthroat. The game will be much more cutthroat with an even number of players (more workers for the same number of spaces).  IMHO, visitors cards are way too powerful. They usually do twice as much as a board action, and sometimes even more. And what's more important, some of them give points! They create a very strong luck element, but then, everybody has their opinion on how much luck they want into their games.   It is gentle worker placement euro with an important luck factor, produces very good sensations.

You can't save them from turn to turn so you never know if you will be able to match currencies together so you play the odds.  At that point the game is yours to lose rather than to win.  If the odds don't line up (either from random card flips of what you can buy, or by getting the cubes you need from the dice) your screwed sucka!  I don't mind random screwage in eurogames like Peloponnes because the game is only 1/2 an hour long here if you get screwed you have to sit out the rest of the game.  The end game is really dull, too.  Many of these engine building euros suffer from each player's ability to do too much and the turns drag, but here it is the opposite, as you reach closer to the end of the game there are fewer options for you (the cubes start drying up).    The real madness is the VP cash-in, who knows if what you are buying into is worth it.  If you are unable to generate the money when the market is right you are screwed.  When three gold will get you 10vps that is the equivalent of delivering all the goods to one region.  How can you feel good about continuing to play the game when you miss that?  The theme not only is nonexistent, but is aberrant from any reality.  Macau has such a cool geographical lay out, yet they ignored it to the point where they put the ocean to the west of the city.

167471,119890,"All Creatures Big and Small is a small 2-player version of Agricola that plays relatively quickly and focuses on animals and pastures. The game removes the feeding portion of the game, as well as plowing/sowing. Some people will see this as a great thing (myself included) because feeding your people is a stressful aspect of Agricola. in addition, you can't grow your family in ACBAS. Each player gets 3 workers and no more additional workers can be attained. I like this as I felt like the person that can grow their family first has the best chance at winning in Agrciola, as long as they didn't get a begging card in the process. The base game is a perfect information game that can be literally played the exact same way, if your opponent were to allow it. This can lead to scripted moves in the first round or two in the game, which is certainly a negative thing.   A lot of people consider at least one of the two expansions to be necessary to own, if you're going to get this game. Each of these expansions include 27 special buildings. You don't need to get one expansion before the other either. The base game includes 4 of which you'll use every game. When using the expansion, the game still is perfect information, but it will shake up beginning moves, because not only will you have the normal 4, but an additional 4 - 8 special buildings that can change people's strategies. Assuming you get an expansion with the base game, ACBAS is a fine entry into the Uwe Rosenberg farming line. If you can't get an expansion, get a different 2-player game.",7.0

93081,148949,"Played twice. In Istanbul, players drift their merchants across locations on the board, dropping off or picking up an assistant each time they do so. Players are tested on how efficiently they can spread their pieces out before having to regroup them. That said, I like the feeling of spreading yourself dangerously thin before snapping back to your full self. It's sort of like this quote:  [center][i]“I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.”[/i][/center] Ahem. Anyway, the rest of the game is your standard convert-stuff-into-gemstones affair. As the locations can be randomised each game, players will compete in recognising the most efficient routes to victory. While this sounds deadly dull, additional elements of randomly moving non-playable characters (a favourite design flourish of the designer's) and delinquent family members mess around with considerations of where to move to next. Opponents' merchants are also obstacles, so there is some welcome friction as players jostle for coveted locations.   What I am wary of is the betting minigame at the Tea House. There may be a way to mitigate luck there, but it feels out of place in a game which otherwise promotes control. (One game I played basically came down to a dice roll at the Tea House.)

Mix of deck building (sort of - you won't acquire new cards at the same rate as Dominion or even A Few Acres of Snow) and arithmetic puzzling in a fantasy, Tolkein-esque setting.  Played competitively, it's essentially a point-grab race - enemies may seem formidable but they're essentially a route to points and powerups, the challenge being how to gather the necessary cards and other resources to beat them as quickly as possible.  In some ways it may be best as a solo or 2 player game as there isn't a great deal of scope for player interaction and (due to the puzzley nature of the gameplay) turns can take a while.  This may make it seem less fun than I meant: I enjoyed it a lot as much as a series of mental challenges as a game.

121994,22545,"AoE is a very cool worker placement game with area majority scoring rules. It plays over 8 rounds spanning 3 ages in which you score each age (and then you score a lot of bonus points at the end of the game). In a sense it’s a much simpler version of Dominant Species as you place your workers on a track, and when every player has placed his workers, they activate from top to bottom.  I like how you have 5 different workers at your disposal, and that these have various powers which give you extra income/units on the board/help you win battles etc. The fact that you have different types of workers really enhances my enjoyment of the game! You need to get new workers, send them to the new world to get goods and score you points, get merchant ships, fight battles against the other players, go on expeditions in undiscovered areas and fight the native, collect trading goods and build new buildings – so you really need to do a lot in the game, but the overall gameplay isn’t too hard to understand. The strategies are plentiful, though!   A couple of things I dislike are these: the exploration is a huge bummer to me as it’s so random – you can send 4 units and lose, while another player can send 1 soldier and still win… That’s really a bad game design I think, and in my games I’ve removed the 1 and 5 tiles so that the luck is less profound. But it still sucks so much when you send 3 guys on an expedition and you fail, because the penalty is quite severe. This means that most of us just wait until we have a strength of 4 until we go on expeditions. The other spot on the board where everybody can place units is the merchant ship, and I also hate that only the winner gets the ship, and the losers lose every single units they spent… Which makes it very important to win (and in general the merchant ships are very handy in order to get income during the game, so they are important). Some buildings are better than others, and it can be a little frustrating that you don’t know which endgame bonus buildings show up in age 3 as they can have a big impact on your whole strategy.  Having read the rules for the expansion, I cannot wait to try that! It sounds as if it makes a great game even better. AoE works with all player counts, but I have to say that, as is the case with most area majority games, it works better with more players. With few players there are also too many open spots on the board to place your workers on. ",8.0

It is at once, the best and worst thing about the game.  If you play with people you don't know, then you can't possibly understand their weird little references, unless they are being totally obvious, which this game punishes. If, however, you play with someone you know very well, then you two will likely dominate the game and leave other players feeling left out.  It's a great game for the RIGHT GROUP, but otherwise, it may fall flat. I'd recommend picking up one or two expansions, just so you have more cards.  After you've seen the one with a living purse, complete with teeth and googly eyes, regurgitating it's contents on the floor in gleeful delight- well, you just can't un-see that.

However, she was able to pick it up quickly after we played a starter 30 point game.  She was annoyed and a bit antagonistic at first--especially after an initial loss.  However, she quickly realized she had been too non-confrontational and attacked heavily, in the second 50 point game, and won!   This game is about as smooth a game as I have run into.  The card design is intuitive and tactical plans are very easy to formulate.   The factions make strategic planning a breeze.  As an added bonus, the card art is deeply impressive.

People who complain about the constant repetition of core game mechanics, in my opinion, are missing the real fun.  It's the same mechanics over and over, sure, but like poker the mechanics aren't the game -- the people are the game, because the game is won or lost by the human's ability to ferret out the toasters.  Humanity is a much more interesting game platform than efficiency engines.

173214,47,"[b]Read Full Comment for Death Spiral[/b]  Chinatown reminded me of Acquire, which I did not expect. You have fewer turns but draw more tiles from the bag. Instead of spending your money on stock, you can spend it negotiating with other players in order to get the tiles and spaces you want. Instead of big payoffs from mergers, you receive steady income from businesses, which ramps up when each business reaches a certain size. Everything is public, so you can see what you have that might be valuable to the other players and vice versa. You spend six turns making deals against the randomness of the draw and see who made the most money. I rather liked Chinatown. Does a lot with a little, and plays in about an hour.  Update (3 plays): Unfortunately, I think the first play is the best play, because people only have a decent feel for what they're doing, rather than an exacting approach that takes into account all future income. In the early game, there is some uncertainty about trading because you don't know who will draw what and change the picture. But even then, I find that players can be a bit disingenuous. I'm willing to articulate exactly what's at stake on either side of a trade. Other players tend to present fuzzy, incomplete, or irrelevant math. Rarely on purpose, of course, but still.   Reading the comments on this game, my guess is that quite a few players don't/can't eyeball a trade and quickly determine it's value. For them, working through future income seems like some kind of lengthy analysis that goes against etiquette. I guess ignorance is bliss.   I'm downgrading Chinatown to a 6. I think it's my first pure negotiation game, and there was a real spark for me before each trade involved the entire game-arc. It's sad that the first play is the best play. Definitely need to try Genoa.   Final Update: My rating slides with each play, and I'm out of patience. I now strongly believe this to be a flawed or problematic design. During my last play, I actually watched the game get worse before my eyes as new players figured out how to calculate the value of tiles. For a brief moment, there's an illusion that you can make deals in good faith based more on a gut feeling of what it ""seems"" to be worth. Once that illusion is crushed, the game goes out the window.   The main issue here is that [b]overwhelmingly[/b], people don't WANT the deal-making to be as deterministic as it is. So you basically have a camp of fans who outright ignore the way the game works, or who make a game out of misrepresenting the way the game works (swindling) and then you have everyone else who does the math. Once you've played a couple of times, I can't imagine that you'd want to be at the table in mixed company, regardless of your angle on the game. ",7.0

15555,108745,"Magical themed card game for 2-4 players. Draft 9 cards and play them across three years, with each season yielding differing energy tokens (water, earth, wind and fire). Cards require varying costs of these energy resources to be put into play. Can be a lot of fun.   PROS: -Interesting card interactions. -Multiple paths to victory. -Each game varies dramatically. -Requires skill on the go to adapt and respond to what other players do to stop you. -Great artwork. -Theme works well, especially the ""seasons"".  -Good amount of player interaction despite the card game nature (familiar cards).  -Players have  a lot of control over the game, being able to influence how fast the seasons progress. -Time always moves forward at least one spot, so the game has a definite end point (can be prolonged but not indefinitely!).     -How many cards you can play is limited by a summoning gauge that starts at zero, with the max being 15 cards you can play across the entire game. Very unique.   CONS: -Can be too long with four players and becomes a pain to keep track of all card interactions. -Crystal board is a terrible way to keep track of currency. Its long and tedious and prone to error. Physical crystal tokens should have been provided.  -Summoning gauge track is very small, should be bigger, possibly with a rotation device or sliding marker. Way too easy to make a mistake.  -Some cards a little too powerful. -Some cards very painful, make the game longer and remove some fun.   Would not readily recommend to another player. To enjoy the game, I made the following changes: -Add physical crystal currency. You will need x50 1-value crystals, x40 5-value crystals and x10 10-value crystals. Look for acrylic 'vase filler' and 'table scatter'. These do perfectly, are cheap and common wedding/ home decor supplies.  -Buy both expansions and remove every 2nd copy of all cards, so there is 100% unique cards (i.e. no doubles). With the expansions, the deck is large enough after being cut in half.  -Remove the following cards entirely: Twist of Fate, Igramul the Banisher, Wonderous Chest, Mesodae's Lantern. Fist two cards became useless because of the modified deck of completely unique cards. Last two cards removed as we found any ability to gain x3 crystals each round too powerful, being a dominant unbeatable strategy. Have also considered removing Arcano Leech and Figrim the Avaricious.

The game also moves along quickly.  For me, the best game from Essen 2007 of the ones I have tried.",8.0

It's about what you would expect from something described that way (you get an additional vector of randomness due to the roll of the dice you draw), but the same principles that apply to other deck-building games -- streamlining, building up currency before turning to points, having dice that interact well with each other -- apply here, and so long as folks enjoy playing with dice, I don't think they'll have a problem with the game.  I can see some potential issues, but they're not enough to turn me away from the novelty of the game.  UPDATE: I'm only two plays in, but so far, I'm not sure that this game has a lasting appeal.  The attrition rate of the game seems very slow for a deck-builder, partly because you don't ever have a guarantee of getting the ride side of the die you buy.

Also, at first glance, Acquire looks like it will be math-heavy, but it doesn't involve anything more than simple addition for the end-game total, everything else is just read off a chart.   I'm glad I got a vintage edition of Acquire. The blinged-out Avalon Hill version from 1999 is pretty cool, but Acquire is still an old-school game that maintains it's old-school feel regardless of how modern the components may be.

46443,155426,"I don't like this one quite as much as suburbia.   Partly that's because it has the same problem as that game, only worse.  Namely, that it feels too short, as though most of the effects in the game aren't going to matter.  Suburbia has an awful lot of buildings that count the things around them and care which types they're placed next to.  But early ones have to be placed next to your board, which doesn't have a type, and later ones aren't going to be filled in around (especially if you use doublers aggressively), a problem which only gets worse if you place borders/lakes.  So, you'll be lucky if you get even 3 residential buildings around your gas station/movie theater/whatever.  But in Castles, [i]every[/i] room cares about its neighbors.  And reciprocal relationships seem rare.  Then you add in the difficulty of placement (which suburbia didn't have, since everything was a hexagon), and trying to get the doors to line up, and the frustration mounts.  I've yet to play a game of this where I didn't feel like I was just slapping rooms together without any real plan.  And even if you do have a plan, it's going to be tough-to-impossible to execute.  You want to close off rooms by adding neighboring rooms with matching doors, but putting together any type of lattice or circle is an uphill battle.  You have no control over what comes out, nor what the other players price things at or buy (more on that later).  So, this unstructured feel fits the theme of the game, but is pretty annoying when you're trying to maximize your points.  The other irritation is the room purchase.  Suburbia's standard queue had its problems.  It was too turn-order dependent, and in a game where money's so tight, too expensive to purchase things up the line.  Castles kills some of those problems, but introduces others.  Now, there's no fixed price for any room.  You can guess, based on the power level & bonuses on offer, what people are likely to buy.  But it's just a guess.  And there really isn't much difference between one room and another, a lot of the time.  Often, players will just snag the cheapest thing available.  Later on, you get info about rooms people have collected, but there always has to be a cheap option and a prohibitively expensive one.  And if things don't go the way you want, you can miss out on your main source of income.  Since there's no carryover from round to round beyond the incentivizing money, the next player in line can undo all your work to keep rooms out of the hands of players who want them.  There's also some swingy-ness in the room types, with many being difficult to close, but the utility ones closing with zero effort and handing out bonus cards worth potentially a lot.  The bonuses themselves vary wildly, with some giving decent points for things you're going to be doing anyway, and others that are hard to do and just not worth it.  The only other type that really stands out is the living rooms, which can score again on closing.  If you devote some effort to it, you can surround a valuable room and score serious points here.  Anyway, with all the chaos going around in the way the tiles come out & are bought, it feels like we're shuffling cards around for an hour, then someone wins.  How?  No idea.  It's currently also suffering from the 'cult-of-the-new'/overplayed syndrome, so it may go up a notch after that wears off.",6.0

Surprisingly deep, with importance placed on orientation of the hexagonal tiles; but the random draws and multi-stage combat can make it difficult to reason about (IMO).  I own the boxed game, but I’ve played the wonderful iOS version many more times.

There is player interaction, mostly in the form of ""I bought this so you can't"". Building buildings on the board is the other main source of player interaction, which is more nuanced than it may seem at first. Your buildings might cause opponents to pay a toll to move through, but they also slow them down. Different strategies need to visit Kansas city more frequently so buildings also offer a way to manipulate the effectiveness of the various strategies.  The game has a lot of little rules but they all hang together well and a single turn is a very simple affair. Move, activate building, draw. The devil is in the details of the actions on buildings. Turns are also surprisingly fast leading to a very smooth game flow. Things slow down a bit when someone reaches Kansas city, but even that only takes about 20 seconds.  Lots of people at the con had concerns about play length. My games were not overly long. The first was 2.5 hours and the second was 2 hours, both with 4 players. The first had all new players and the second had 3 new players. So I didn't experience the game dragging at all, but that is a common complaint so if you have AP issues in your group perhaps this one will drag.   I'm very interested in playing this more. There's lots to learn about how to play well and I like that. I have yet to see someone build the really expensive buildings.

28188,144733,"A solid worker-placement game but compared to similar games, there are a few issues I found.    Like the German educational system, you basically have to pick your career path/track rather early on in the game before you really know what you are doing or what or want to do and stick to it right until the end; changing a strategy halfway through isn’t really an option.    It is generally to the benefit of each player to take a different track/path so that they are not competing over resources.  This takes away from the very tension of most worker-placement games of trying to anticipate/bluff with other players to see who will snap up much needed resources first.  Basically, you pick a unique track/path and continuously place workers on the same spaces round after round to continuously to obtain all the resources you need and keep doing it until the end of the game with the hope that your path is more successful than anyone else’s path.  Thus, the game feels very scripted.  Some paths also do seem more convoluted than others, but apparently the designers of the game do say each track/path is a viable one to victory.    Something that I'm not a fan of is that you can actively look though the special action cards and select the one that you want.  This stops the game dead-in-its-track (as players read through the rule book and debate which one to take), experienced players automatically know which cards to get which brings me to my third point: some special actions seem overpowered compared to others and feel unbalanced in the game.  This seems apparent in the run-away leader problems here as scores between players vary much more widely here than in similar worker placement games.    Many people complain about Euro-games being dry, soulless and without theme; however while I almost always disagree with that statement (good mechanics in a game are always better than theme), ""Russian Railroads"" really is the poster-child for that criticism.  You basically take a spot so you can move a black cube to the right, so that you can later take a spot to move a brown cube, then a white cube, and that's basically it.  At no point do I feel this game has anything to do with railroads or building a railroad company.  And as for interaction: while I'm not a big proponent for mandated-interaction in games, this is one of the few games where we really all sat in complete silence as taking spots doesn't really interfere much with other players (see 'everyone takes their own unique path' statement above).    While it is a solid and well thought-out game mechanically, I would recommend games such as Pillars of the Earth, Lords of Waterdeep, Lancaster, Agricola/Caverna over this one as they are more balanced, streamlined, interactive, thematic and engaging.     As a lark, they should re-theme this game with Gymnasium, Realschule, and Hauptschule tracks. ",8.0

120562,167791,"Played it once, a 3-player game. We felt it was an ok game, yet it overstayed its welcome. We played the shorter variant with advanced corporations, no drafting. So almost the simplest game, apart from the corporations and the initial purchasing of cards (which we did). Yeah... my fears about limited interaction turned out to be right. There's a big emphasis on your own engine optimization. There *is* interaction though, and it potentially may be significant with more experienced players: on the map, fights for milestones, awards or final opportunities for terraforming. We just felt that most of the time we weren't really interested in what cubes other players pushed left and right on their player boards. Interaction came close to the end. However the game lasted more than 2 hours, so we were a bit tired towards the end. Then we felt like there was a luck of draw. Could be fixed by the official drafting variant, but at the same time the game would drag even longer. Overall we think there are better games with limited interaction that we can play in shorter time, which we enjoy more at the same time: The Castles of Burgundy, Bruges and Suburbia came to our minds, they kind of scratch the same itch for us (although imo Suburbia has nice level of interaction, but it has that tableau building thing).

Gameplay is quick but surprisingly deep and this can be a great game as a filler, main play, or beer 'n pretzels.

The game scales well for all player numbers and the special cards add a surprising amount of variety and tactics. The finite hand size (until all other players need to draw) adds a touch of (light) strategy to the game, in addition to the tactical card play when engaging in battles.

The game consists of 4 years, with each year consisting of 4 rounds, with a nice twist in that the length of a round is variable depending on the actions that players choose.  The core mechanic is unique (at least to me) in that you move clockwise and stepwise, action markers around a ""rondel"" of sorts and choose the action where you placed last with your action marker.  There are 6 different actions to choose from, and all of them are generally good although some are significantly better than others depending on the situation/your setup/end of game bonus cards etc.  After movement of action markers, you can potentially complete a bonus trajan tile (which awards points and a one-time ability bonus) if you've set yourself up/planned appropriately, then you get the one action you landed on.  Actions are: 1)military conquests, which have multiple options, but which can score points, 2) construction, which scores one-time points and either allows for big end game points or one-time immediate second action, 3) trajan tile selection, which can be used to replenish your ""rondel"" and thus score you more points and get you more benefits, 4) shipping, which is an opportunity to score big points by playing goods cards in one of 3 different possible combinations, 5) senate action, which scores points, and positions you for first choice at end of round bonus tiles, which can score big points at game end, and 6) forum, which is where you grab tiles such as votes for senate, requirements for the people, extra action bonuses.  At the end of a year, you need to satisfy the needs of the people or lose negative points (kind of like feeding your family in Agricola but not as punitive, and not as punitive as some other Feld games).  Again at end game, points are scored in addition to the points accumulated in game (the in-game points are very significant as well as the end-game ones).

39226,31260,"I'm not sure I've ever played a game as delightfully maddening as Agricola.  The game play is brutally unforgiving - rare is the game of Agricola where every single player doesn't feel like the game is going terribly.  Fortunately, though, the pastoral theme goes a long way towards blunting the games' harshness. It hits the sweet spot between having many options on any given turn and not being completely overwhelming, and the food requirement adds a good amount of tension to the game and requires a sometimes painful balance between short term needs and long term strategy.  The occupation and improvement cards give the game immense replay value as you try to discover the best card combinations in your hand.  I'm knocking off a half point for the fiddliness of replenishing resources, but that's a very minor complaint.  Overall a very excellent game.  Updated to say that my original rating is for playing with the basic decks.  After limited experience with the complex and interactive decks I would rate the game lower when playing with either of those, as the cards are way too unbalanced (based on playing the iPad game, combining all the decks seems to be okay, the above comment refers to using the K and I decks in isolation).",7.0

The rules were a bit confusing on some things, LNoE is a light, fun game but it took us a bit to get everything sorted out which is weird for a game that is fairly simple in its mechanics. Nevertheless, to me this is fun in a box. Thematic details where chance decides whether the heroes pitchfork breaks or the shot you fired hit the Zombie deadly round the movie-like experience, the soundtrack the game comes with is a neat bonus that I appreciate. We played with 4 (2 hero players, 2 Zombie players) which worked very well, need to see how other combinations play out. If you want strategy, clearly look somewhere else, but if you want to fight or be a Zombie, look no further. Looking forward to trying more of the scenarios, great game for Halloween!

This is both great and sometimes annoying depending which side you are on, but at least players rarely feel that they are playing a losing game for too long. A couple of lucky searches can have all heroes armed and strong in fights. A couple of unlucky rolls can break all weapons and get a hero killed quickly. Some missions are definitely intended to be more of a challenge for the heroes (Search missions require luck on the cards picked up and the mansion defense is a desperate situation that requires lots of luck to win).

It was thanks to the PC on line version that I could play it ""hardcore"" (read many times) and I was in shock by the lack of lasting appeal ... due to the luck this game is all about.  DICE + CARDS + limited surface = a game with more than 80% based on luck = sadly not so good as I thought.  Curiously PC versions of board games will show the strong but also the WEAK points of a design.  And Memoir 44 falls short in the luck category. As a matter of fact it IS a complete turd as ""an historical wargame"".  While games like Small World and Ticket to Ride opened up extreme good gameplay features, Memoir44 falls flat on its face by playing it many times.  A pity since I collected all the expansions. What a waste of time and money...  Basic Mem 44 is not a historical simulation, it is much too much based on luck and it is crippled on limiting mechanics.   The only good thing for the fans is the Campaign books I guess so you can ride some long term games with it. Not much historical wargames of course.  ---------  Update Edit: I upped it to 4 now after having tried the new breakthrough mapboards. It is now starting to look like a light wargame at least, but it still is far from a WW2 simulation. I guess with all the latest expansions included (breakthrough/winter war/new miniatures/campaign books), a ""6"" is perhaps deserved, BUT the basic box still stays an ugly simulation and a broken game with a WW2 themed attached to it as an afterthought.  You can have LOTS and LOTS of better stuff with these 300 Euro's in expansions. Perhaps start with C&C Napoleonics for a better wargame from the same author.

99356,37111,"Never have I been so conflicted in my opinion of a game. We played two back-to-back games with the same six people—no one was the same character and we swapped out seats.  There’s a LOT of good stuff here.   The theme is well done. The characters are very distinct. Each one has a special power, a once-a-game bigger power, and a weakness. So Roslin can look at the top two cards of the Crisis Deck (Bad Things) and decide which to implement and which to put on the bottom. Her weakness is that she’s “sick,” so has to discard two cards to activate a space. Tighe’s weakness is Alcoholism, so if he ever only has one card in his hand, he has to discard that one, too. So the people have specific traits that fit them—though very abstracted.   You face some of the same challenges that they face in the show: food shortages, attacks, Cylons boarding the ship. You’re trying to jump away from the Cylons, so cards slowly allow the FTL drive to ramp up, and when it’s far enough along you can attempt to jump early--but at the risk of losing population because you leave ships behind. Or you can wait a bit longer and auto-jump. But the longer you wait the more you’re getting beat up by Cylon ships. It’s a cool gamble. Our second game came down to one die roll. The humans were down to 3 population, but really had no choice but to try to jump early. They rolled a D8, and on a 1-6 they’ll lose 3 population (and thus the game). If they roll a 7 or 8 they don’t lose any pop and win the game. They rolled an 8 and went NUTS. It was a great gaming moment (even though I was a Cylon and lost).  The Loyalty idea is cool--particularly the fact that a new set is dealt out halfway through the game. In our first game, no one was a Cylon until the second half; then we had two. In the second game there was one from the beginning, one at the halfway, and then I was a Sympathizer halfway, and since the humans were winning I became a revealed Cylon. As in most games of this type, being the traitor is fun.   I have never felt such a sense of paranoia as in this game. Part of it was that our group really knows each other well, so there was a lot of smack-talk and goofing around. But everything is scrutinized, and there’s a lot of opportunity for sabotage. You can throw bad cards into skill checks to hose the deal, and people can’t be sure who did it because there are two random cards thrown in that could be any color, and all cards are shuffled before you look at them. And you can start throwing blame around: “Hey, that blue card really hurt us. And so-and-so is the only person who draws blue cards...” No one trusted anyone--it was [i]awesome[/i]!  But the bad:  First, it’s long. Way too long. Each of our two games took around 3 hours--with fast players. This might be forgivable if there was more to do when it’s not your turn, but there’s a lot of downtime. This would obviously be different with fewer players, but I wonder how in the world you’d pass some of those skill checks with only 3 people...especially with one person being a Cylon.  The cards are pretty boring. There are only a couple variations in each color, but much of the time they weren’t interesting enough to use (other than reroll cards, and help-pass-a-skill-check ones). I also thought the action spaces were pretty boring. “Well, there are no Cylon ships right now, and we’re not damaged. I guess I’ll move here and draw another card.” Yawn.   I think the game is skewed toward the Cylons. They won in 3 of the 4 games last night, and there was a 75% chance they win in the fourth one, too. Since each person has a specific skill set, it could be that both your pilots in the game end up being Cylons. The humans are screwed if something like that happens.   I know the ultimate question is whether it was fun, and I have to say: sometimes. Most turns were pretty dang boring. It was more interesting once I found out I was a Cylon, and then when the game moved into the End Phase we were all pretty involved. But that was after two-and-a-half hours of not-exciting gameplay (but way fun paranoia and finger-pointing).   Before I played I thought I’d probably end up buying this. Now I know I won’t. I’ll play someone else’s copy, but it would have to be with the right group--and I’d have to be prepared for 3 hours of one okay game. ",6.0

Your actions makes sense, thus the rules are easy to remember also for families.  Not really dry, but a bit of a calculating machine.

It's about timing and planning your strategy for several rounds ahead.    I have only one real major negative issue with this game: the freaking catch-up-mechanic. This is a really harsh one, much more dominant than that in Power Grid for example. In reality: once you get ahead, you have practically some ""wasted"" turns: it is no use place your workers on the market, since those players behind in points would get there earlier to buy it all.

141823,128882,"This is an ""updated"" version of The Resistance, with more roles which bring neat little twists to the game. So, this is a hidden role game, where every player gets assigned (randomly and secretly) either the role of a bad guy or a good guy. Once everyone has looked at their cards, everyone closes their eyes and, when called for, the evil guys open their eyes so they can see who they will be playing with. Once this is done, everyone closes and then opens their eyes at the same time. One player is then chosen as ""team leader"". He will select from 2-5 players to go on a mission, contingent on how many players are playing (up to 10!) and whether or not it is mission 1 to 5 (the amount of agents increases as the rounds proceed). There is a vote by each player to see if they agree with who will be sent out, and if the majority agrees, the team attempts the mission (or quest in Avalon). Each of the player selected for the mission receives two cards - Success or Failure. They then select one card and discard the other one *without showing anyone*. Once each member of the team has made their selection, the cards are shuffled (to hide who played what) and are revealed. Should they all be Success, the mission was successful. Should there be even one Failure, the mission went south and failed. The good guys are trying to get 3 Successful mission while the bad guys are trying to get 3 Failed mission. So far, so Resistance. Now here comes the wrinkles: instead of being generic good guys/bad guys, there are specific roles, such as Merlin, who gets to know who the bad guys are, but! if the bad guys successfully identify him at the end of the game, they win, even if they didn't get their 3 Failures. There is also Percival who gets to know who Merlin is. He should only be played with Morgana, who can pretend to be Merlin when Percival gets to find out. This can cause lots of laughter and confusion during the game as Merlin tries to hint at who the bad guys are without letting anyone know who he is since he might get killed at the end, thus losing! And Percival who sort of knows who Merlin is but not really! There's other roles too, but the only other one we played with was Lancelot... or rather the two Lancelot, one who is good and one who is bad. The thing is... they can change place. At the start of any mission, you flip a card. If it is blank, nothing changes, but should it show the two Lancelot, the good one becomes evil and the evil one becomes good. Lots of laughs, lots of fun, will be bringing it again. Fun fun fun.",7.0

It shares many things with its elder relative: a variable and ever changing row of cards to acquire, the presence of just two ""currencies"" (money for purchasing and military to attack), the powers triggered by playing cards of the same faction.  What is different, then? The answer is simple: it is a bloody, fierce, fast and furious duel! Each player struggles to knock off the opponent, by reducing his life from 50 to 0.  So, unlike Ascension you don't build military to defeat monsters from the center row, but to outright crush your opponent.  Another difference lies in bases: they're permanent assets (well, permanent until destroyed, anyway!) capable to provide resources during many turns, and also give players some protection (outposts).  All considered, it's an improvement on Ascension (even if the iOS app is worst than the Ascension app), with a more streamlined design, and much more tension. And it plays definitely faster!",9.0

I find it strangely compelling in a way that Descent 2 was not for me.  Perhaps there is some merit in stripping the idea down to its essence.  I think the idea of slowing developing my character is the hook for me.  Whether that is enough to keep me interested through 6 adventure decks remains to be seen.  UPDATE Oct 2014: We're about halfway through adventure 1, and the shine is starting to come off this a bit.  We'll see how far we get.  I think that the most interesting thing about this game is the way you build your character, and while that is fairly novel for this type of game, I am not sure I ultimately find that compelling enough to sustain my enthusiasm.    UPDATE Nov 2014: Well, my son (age 7) gave me a very well reasoned agruement as to why Pathfinder was not his favorite game.  ""I have to wait 10 minutes between my turns, and when it is my turn I barely know what I'm doing.""  Fair enough.  As for me, I am finding the game repetitive, and gaining a +1 here and there is no longer thrilling me.  I am also perplexed as to how I continue to find this game so finicky to deal with rules-wise.   I think I'll be turning to Lord of the Rings Card Game for a similar questing card game, but with more interesting mechanisms.  I'm also looking forward to Assault on Doomrock, which I hope will be more of what I hoped to get out of Pathfinder.  I just don't think the long campaign thing is for me with this particular game.  I think this game may be too reliant on the appeal of slowly leveling up, and the game guts underneath aren't really interesting and varied enough to sustain the game long-term.

The aim is to increase your colonies and the workers, factories, churches and shipyards within them, which both aid your development and count towards victory points. As in all rondel games you have to determine which choices to pass over and how to develop the balanced strategy needed to be successful i.e. there is no point building ships if you don't have the necessary currency and workers available to colonise. In several previous releases ('Antike', 'Imperial', 'Hamburgum' etc) designer Mac Gerdts has proven that he can combine the rondel as a driving mechanism excellently with games that provided numerous strategic challenges, and each new publication feels quite differently from the last (no simple rehashing of old ideas here).

This one has good heritage so it may come out well.  Then again, FFG didn't do so well with Arkham Horror so who knows?  UPDATE:  I caved and bought the new edition. Verdict? The game stays true to the original and has some well developed features. I like the new night/day conditions. I like the addition of Mina Harker for 5 players. The package is well made and looks handsome.  What did I not like? Well, I'm not a fan of the huge amount of cards the Dracula player has to deal with. I like the old screen (easier to manage. If a Dracula player cheats, that's just sad). I also imagined that the redevelopment would shave playtime but it's actually as long or potentially longer than the original. This is probably owing to the fixed Dracula victory conditions of getting 6 vampire points.  All in all, I would say that the new developments amount to a 10% improvement over the original and isn't really worth the upgrade for the owners of the original. ",7.0

I can't think of another game that turned me off from playing it even once, but this game's dense, confusing, and bland rulebook, ridiculous '...meat eating habits we continue to this day' intro (shame on you Uwe Rosenberg for not adding 'bad' in front of habits and insinuating this is a game focused on meat farming.), and reviews of 'solitaire' sure don't make we want to slog through learning it or teaching it to others. The endless rules questions on BGG is another warning sign. Do you really want to bother with figuring out 360 cards and their combos? Sorry, but I had enough of that crap with MTG. Lesson learned: ignore hype and 'appreciating' a game just because it knocked another sucky game like Puerto Rico out of the number one spot. I've began to realize the majority of the entire top ten on this site is a joke and doesn't belong there.   This is one case of too many cards. Really ads AP downtime to the game, as everyone struggles to find out what their cards mean and how they interact with each other. By the final third of the game, there are at least 25 actions you can choose from! Seriously, this is deranged. I understand that this game will take ten plays to become clearer, but I doubt most people will have the patience to reach that number. 7 hours for our first 3 player game, with ONE person in AP mode.

35516,107529,"2012-11-27  Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2012)  This weekend I managed to play two new games from Vaccarino. Infiltration and this one. As I love Dominion, I was keen to play Kingdom Builder. I wasn’t expecting a heavy game as Kingdom Builder won the Spiel des Jahres this year (2012) and I was right, otherwise I would have been disappointed.  As a friend was explaining this game to me, I thought I would not like the game, however when we played it I found that I do like it. It is a very simple game to teach and learn, however it has more depth that I initially thought. It has a lot of luck of the draw, but I feel the player with the best strategy will usually win it more times than not. It still remains a light game, not one I want to play often but I would play it from time to time. The game plays fast enough.   Theme wise the game is very weak. As with Dominion and Infiltration, the game has a huge replayability factor, as you play with different goal cards and tiles each time, each game is different and that is a very good thing in my book.  For me, Kingdom Builder is reminiscent of Trough the Dessert, but with less tension as you have so many space to settle.  A game I will play again, but not one I feel any compulsion to own. [hr] 2013-11-05  After another play, I found I was wrong. The luck of the draw is very prominent on this game making me lower its rating.   I won’t pursue more games of KB, and I will offer some resistance to it. Most probably I will buy it for the iPad to play it quickly, but this is not a game I like.   Current Rating: 5.0   ",7.0

I already have pandemic, so can't see keeping this in my collection.  And if I want a dice based coop, then I've also got Space Hulk: Death Angel, which is much more thematic and has great tension.

If two roles are tied, we put them both on the same space.  This leads to more scarcity which is good.  There are a lot of dice and some luck, but not as much as you would think because there are a lot of different directions you can go.  The key is being adaptable.

It's now genuinely possible to block or at least delay, a small company from automatically achieving its bonus.   This offers far more possibilities.

38487,31730,":indigo: :( :what: :) :D :) :what: As tightly and beautifully designed as any game I've ever played. As many rules as are needed, with no more. As much complexity as needed, with no more. A tremendous amount of depth in a game that you can teach in 15 minutes and play in 45. 50% of the game is in the auctions, 45% in controlling the tempo of the game (and when to trigger the end), everything else is the frosting. Putting a share up for auction can several things at once: it can dilute the value of existing shares, it pumps money into a railroad, it can implicitly offer other players to join you in pushing a road you already own, it can implicitly sow division between the members of an existing partnership, and it means that someone is giving up a chunk of their hard-earned kitty, which is both their capital and their victory points.  Once you understand this, Chicago Express reveals its true identity as a nasty, filthy game of trust and betrayal. It takes a pretty extraordinary set of moves to run companies that make you enough money to win without help from [i]somebody[/i].  Agricola Syndrome is a problem for n00bs -- you'll set up a railroad that would absolutely win the whole damn thing for you if the game lasted twice as many turns as it did. But it doesn't, so it won't, so you just screwed yourself with your pants on, Giselle.  If a dominant strategy is emerging in your group, change up, it's groupthink. A good group who plays regularly will see fads emerge -- you'll go from ""The Person Who Controls The PRR Controls The Universe"" to ""Why Would Anyone Buy Into This Broke-Ass Railroad"" and from there to a more moderate opinion over time.  The only knock on this is stockholding games are not everyone's idea of fun, nor are auction games, so some people will not see it. But for the rest of us, it's as good as it gets.  Best with four players, but playable with 3 or 5.",8.0

I like that if you use your skills to back up your choices, you tend to fair better. The destiny die throws curve balls at your plans every so often.  This is not a strategy game and winning seems to come from a combination of factors and good choices is only one of them. Victory feels a little more than a timer to let everyone know that the story has come to a conclusion.   I like TotAN for what it is. A light adventure game in a unique setting.  I still think your best bet is to roleplay your character. Choose skills that make sense together. If you have weapon use, attack people. If you prefer to talk, choose seduction, beguiling, Courtly Graces/Storytelling. If you want to explore, Enduring Hardship, Wilderness Lore and Wisdom or Magic are good bets.

I don't like:  0) essentially zero player interaction aside from the bizarre raze mechanic 1) how similar all the factions are to each other 2) how rushed I feel to get stuff done in only five rounds 3) the combat is ridiculously shallow and should just be taken out, or expanded 4) confusing and overly long rules text (wait, how do I raze my buildings versus other players'?) 5) lots of ""I gotta remember that this building generates this resource each turn"" 6) way too much text to read on the cards, which slows down the pace  The whole game just feels ""off"" somehow. I love 4X type games when they're computer games, so I figured I would like this game, but it's in serious need of polishing the rules and gameplay flow. Maybe a revamped 2.0 version in a couple years could convince me to try it again.",7.0

17823,77130,"I played many different board games in my life, and most of then I played a lot. But I have never played a game as good as Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game. First of all, the box and the components are awesome. The quality of all tokens, map tiles, figures and cards is excelent. Even the manual has a high quality standard. For the game price, it's crazy. Also, the game is gorgeus. It's impossible to stay impassible to the board when the game is set up, even my wife that understand nothing from these games spend some time just looking to the table when the game is there.  But the best part is yet to come. The game is absolutely awesome. I read most of the negative comments here, and clearly most people played the game 1 time (some even less!). 1 user gave a bad rate and said that the combat should be decided in a throw of the dice... crazy.  The rules are detailed, but very intuitive. Of course, you'll need to play the game 3-5 times to play it perfectly without looking the manual once, until you get the hang of it. But which complex game isn't like this? Basically, the turn is divided in 5 steps:  1 - Build new cities and/or change government; 2 - Collect trade; 3 - City Action; 4 - Movement; 5 - Research tech.  The four paths to victory are balanced well enough, but this will be VERY affected by the way your group plays. If your players always go for economic wins, for example, you may think that the economic win is overpowered and unbalanced... but this is not the case. Just check the forum, there are groups complaining that tech, militar, culture and economic victories are overpowered... if all are overpowered, none is.  The combat of the game is simple, but strategic. There is little randomness involved, so you must be prepared to attack and to defend. There is surprise enough with the randomness involved (size and power of your army) and with the culture cards, there is also surprise enough. This, with the tech resource abilities, make the battle very pleasant and thrilling.  The game is played between 150 to 180 minutes. The game is 80% played simultaneously by all players, so it does not get boring and you are always thinking and planning.  In general, there is not much randomness involved in the game, which is great. I don't to play a 3 hour strategic game that in the end was decided by luck.  Just get it and play. I haven't played a better game in my life.",8.0

The card combos are not nearly as impressive as Dominion, but the game play is welcomed because it does play different enough by having cards to use towards the board.

94695,27627,"OK, I'll tell you up front that the supposed ""discerning"" gamers who bitch and moan about the luck/randomness/chaos in TALISMAN or the assumption that the game lacks ""meaningful choices"" (whatever that means in the context of a f&%king board game)just don't get it.  They never will, and for those Days of Wonder shills, middle managers, and spreadsheet fanatics there's plenty of games out there to satisfy their desire to amoritize, impress, and bid their way to victory.  Make no mistake- the 4th edition of TALISMAN will not make you a believer if you didn't like it to begin with, nor should it because it is first and foremost a return of the classic 2nd edition of the game which has not, contrary to some opinions here, become ""dated"" or ""aged poorly"". Nor is the appeal of the game somehow limited to some hazy sense of nostalgia.  In fact, having not played the base game without expansions, I was really amazed at how good a game TALISMAN really is- even with THE CITY, DUNGEON, TIMESCAPE, et. al. stripped away.  It's simple, almost elemental, and definitely classical.  But dated?  That's like saying that Johnny Cash records are dated.  No- it doesn't feature the currently in-vogue mechanics and it's not one of these oh-so-clever minimalist Eurogames where the designer's goal was to abstract everything interesting away to a simple flowchart.  But that doesn't make it any less vital, exciting, and fun, then it was when I played it for the first time nearly 20 years ago.  What's more significant is that returning to TALISMAN made me realize that a lot of what's missing in games today is a real sense of character, a palpable heart and soul that makes the game truly unique.  Even amongst games like TALISMAN inspired games like PROPHECY or FFG's fantasy titles, TALISMAN stands out as something singular in the hobby that has proven over the past 25 years to be a timeless, perennial game that will likely be played and enjoyed long after the faddish games that litter the hobby now are long forgotten.  Fortunately, this is also the best produced edition of TALISMAN to date although I do  miss the old GW-style artwork but it's a beautiful set that manages to capture baroque 1980s-style fantasy with modern production values in a very classy package.  Black Industries has really got their work cut out for them now- I'm already ready for the expansions!",7.0

Everything is very clear and very straight forward. But the combinations do offer multiple strategies to explore, lots of different ways to score points.

80411,30549,"Overall, my cooperative game crown still goes to Knizia's Lord of the Rings. But while Lord of the Rings is a co-op game that really requires a group of ""gamers"", Pandemic is a go-to game for any group of people.  The tension around the table is just palpable playing Pandemic, and the game plays in under an hour, so it's really perfect for a weeknight get together with friends. To succeed, team members must really plan things out together. If each player simply pursues his or her own ""plan"", then the group is sure to lose the game, especially on Normal or (god forbid) Heroic settings. Pandemic is an ultra-cooperative game. This is its greatest asset, but also the thing about it which I foresee will put me off a bit over time. There is little room for autonomy and self-determination. Success requires the closest sort of collaboration. So be warned: play this only with people you like! If you play it with someone you don't have a lot of patience with, you *will* want to throttle them. Pandemic throws very difficult situations right in the face of the players, and good brainstorming is required to win the game. If someone is being boorish and trying to ""quarterback"" the whole game, you will be driven to distraction. Likewise if someone is being an utter dolt and failing to grasp the plan that the group came up with.  Again, VERY tense. VERY exciting. LOADS of fun. But play it with the right people. Otherwise Pandemic possesses the potential to devolve into an exercise in frustration. It also shines with 3-4 players, but the tension is significantly less with only 2. This is because 2 players can tightly coordinate their actions, working as a team and moving more or less together around the world in order to cure the diseases. With 3 and 4 players, it's harder to get ahead of the intensity curve - the point where, after a few epidemics, you start infecting new cities without any disease (and hence a lesser chance of outbreaks). Because of this, I think 3-4 player games are actually slightly more challenging than 2 player games.  Components: the board is crap. The disease cubes, pawns, research stations, and cards are all just fine. But I'd shell out another $10 for a decent board. This one warps, wrinkles, smells funny, and peels up from the edge. I like the size of it, I like the art and design. It's the physical quality which is just dismal. That's a shame when it affects such a super game.  Update: this one has settled at a perpetual 7 for me. When I like it, I love it. But it's not really something I'm in the mood for any time, in plenty of situations I'd just rather not play it. You have to be in the mood to do the group-think thing, communicating extensively with the other players at every turn, in order to win. And sometimes, I feel that players can make all the right choices (optimal ones) and still lose due to luck and game balance. If this weren't so, it is true that Pandemic would lose some tension, as it would become a puzzle - solvable by an experienced group of players. That would be a shame, and a downfall. Yet the game falls down anyway, as once you ARE very experienced, it is frustrating to lose a perfectly played game. For some reason, this complaint doesn't arise for me when playing Lord of the Rings. The balance of choices in LotR maintains at least the illusion that your success depends only on your choices.  Anyway, despite my gripes I rate Pandemic a ""strong buy"" for its accessibility, tension, and short play-time.",7.0

146183,102680,"(03/21/2014) Comment based on one play.  This is by far Stephen Feld's best of the various ""point salad"" games I've played--[thing=25554][/thing], [thing=70512][/thing], and [thing=84876][/thing]. It is a clever blending of familiar mechanisms from other games, along with a brilliant implementation of the mancala mechanism, seen in [thing=1970][/thing].  This game is a step towards a more deterministic point salad game, rather then the stochastic CoB, where the action choices were randomly generated by dice. Instead, the mancala acts as sort of a ""rondel"" (as found in [thing=19600][/thing]) hybrid, both allowing a selection of one of six actions--the last pebble sowed selects the action--and pick of a ""Trajan"" tile, if the conditions are met. Although the mancala seems chaotic and random, there is no luck--the player has complete control over the set of possible future actions, as well as the sequencing of them. Further, the number of ""pebbles"" sowed serves as the game clock, moving the game along the four sub-quarters of a quarter of a year, for a full year. A number of smaller moves can result in more turns per sub-quarter, but there will eventually be an acceleration in the game, when a player eventually has all or most of their pebbles clustered in a bowl or two.  As with his other point salad games, it seems that almost every action will result in a gaining of VP. The challenge and appeal of the game is in the search of maximizing VP per action or trading off less VP for a more lucrative payoff later in a combination of actions.  The VP landscape for two of the six action types is randomly generated at the beginning of the game, but is held relatively fixed for the rest of the game. The map of Europe has regions with known VP values, but has randomly assigned bonus tiles in each space. A sequence of military actions can first get the bonus tile through movement of the leader, followed by placement of a legion to secure the VP for that space. There is also a 4x5 grid of Rome, with randomly assigned building tiles, each with a VP value. A sequence of build actions can result in placement of workers to claim a building tile and associated VP value, as well as triggering an extra action for first-time builds for each of the six building types. Interestingly, subsequent workers must be placed orthogonally, much like the placement of tokens in the districts in [thing=531][/thing]; as such there is area control and blocking.  Each season, a ""Voice of the People"" tile is revealed, much like the ""Voice of the People"" in [thing=554][/thing], where the players must collect specific bonus tiles (from the forum or from military actions) to offer as tribute to placate the people--in terms of ""bread"" and ""circuses"" or piety--lest they lose VP. This punitive feature is similar to the ""rat track"" in Notre Dame, but as with ND, there usually is enough time to prepare. The main focus in satisfying this demand is either through military action by moving a leader into a space with a bonus tile, or initiating the forum action, where there is a random assortment of bonus tiles and bonus action tiles. With other Feld titles, VPs and other incentives are offered to the players briefly, before being removed from the game. The same holds true for the forum tiles.  The senate action has a two-fold function, both determining the seniority order for the next year and correspondingly increasing VP for every subsequent action, but also for determining who will be ""consul"" and selecting one of two end-of-game bonus conditions. A ""vote"" is taken at the end of every year, with the tally being the sum of the senator's standing, plus any ""vote"" bonus tiles they've picked up from forum and military actions. These are similar to the civilization cards in [thing=34635][/thing], since they give more VP for collecting specific commodity cards, or other lucrative VP bonuses.  The shipping action allows players to draw commodity cards randomly, where they try to form unique sets, and them playing them out on their play area. The commodity symbols behave much like the symbols in [thing=9216][/thing], where huge VP counts can be gained for such as 2/3/4 unique commodities, 2/3/4 of of the same, or pairs of commodities. The selected bonus conditions could give additional VP for playing specific commodities.  The last of the six actions is selecting a ""Trajan"" tile. Surrounding the mancala are six slots, where the Trajan tiles are placed. The last pebble sowed triggers both the action and possible selection of the trajan tile associated with that action. Each Trajan tile has two pebble colors; if the bowl contains the two pebble colors that correspond to that tile, the VP on the tile are awarded, along with an extra build placement, military placement, bread/circus/piety capability, +2 extra action tile, etc.   As can be seen with this long-winded comment, this seems to be an extremely complex game, with many, many intertwining mechanisms, but each of the six ""mini games"" is not that difficult. Still, rules explanation took approximately 45 minutes, but familiarity with CoB and other Feld games was helpful in shortening that time. Thus, this is not a game one could conceivably take to a board game meetup, since it would take too much time to set up and explain. The game has strong random elements in how the VP landscape and in how the ""Voice of the People"" are formed, how the forum bonus tiles fall out, end-of-game bonus conditions, as well as how the Trajan tiles come out. Beyond that, the mancala gives the players complete control over their destinies. So, this is more in line with traditional VP layout games. Still, the players are overwhelmed by the assortment of VP paths available. AP with the mancala is a strong possibility, and with three or four player, downtime could suffer. Despite this, the mancala mechanism alone is a fascinating game mechanism to explore; however, it's internal workings seem to have no corresponding meaning to reality! While the selected actions are meaningful within the context of the theme of ancient Rome, I cannot rationalize [i]why[/i] or [i]how[/i] that action was generated--yeah, the last ""pebble"" was thrown into the ""forum"" action bowl, and the colors of two of the pebbles in that bowl happen to match the Trajan tile that is associated with that bowl. What does that mean? Why do I care?  What does fulfilling a Trajan tile really mean? Perhaps that is why some call the theme pasted-on. If one is willing to look past this inherent ""weakness"" or ""disconnect"", this is a great game--this may be Feld's best game, but that remains to be seen. Initial rating: ""9"", with potential to move up. ",7.0

The title and fantasy theme are pretty silly, and the artwork is much maligned; but I think the artwork is actually rather pretty if unconventional for the fantasy genre.  I got a lot of play out of this, but in retrospect there’s not much to it; there’s some tactical play but the strategies are fairly obvious, and luck is a huge factor.

Interesting asymmetry, though I'm not sure it feels exactly right that all the rebels need to do is hide their base. In War of the Ring (another epic, asymmetric game), it really does feel right that all the world can be war-torn, as long as the ring is destroyed. But in this, it doesn't feel right that everyone can get annihilated, planets destroyed and subjugated, but as long as the rebel base hasn't been found yet, the rebels win when the timer is up. That's not actually the right win condition - it should be blowing up the death star twice, or defeating the emperor, or something like that. I could imagine that nearly the whole galaxy could be controlled by the dark side, but once the emperor is killed, the rebels win. Or once the death star is destroyed again, the rebels win.

As I’ve written elsewhere, the painstaking care that obviously went into the core game and all other expansions is just as remarkable a creative feat to me as the original deckbuilding idea itself.  And somehow I feel as though Alchemie got a bit less of that devoted development than its siblings, making it both the smallest and the ugliest (or, more proberly, least attractive) runt of the litter. This shows both in the convoluted mechanics of cards like Possession and in the uncomfortable scaling of the inherent value of potions with different kingdom tableaus - with too many cards that need a potion, its purchase becomes automatic as soon as you have 4 or even 5 money at hand, whereas too few of them means that they won’t get used even as a stopgap measure, because you’re never going to buy that initiating potion.  Nevertheless, Alchemie was a worthwhile purchase for me, but if you don’t feel that you need each and every Dominion expansion, this is probably one you can easily give a pass on. ",7.0

The options are immense and offer a multitude of different paths to victory, ensuring no two games will play out the same. Tiles are easy to understand and finding quality combinations is fun and intuitive.  It does have some down sides. Keeping score gets tricky as your city grows and the score track can be a bear to manage, but it doesn't get in the way of the game's execution.",8.0

116463,39856,[4-12] Brilliant party game/filler.  The tiny details in strategy relating to creating a phrase that works but not too clear as well as trying to put another card that captures the other players is a lot of fun.  Certainly fills the gap that Apples to Apples created and became quickly burned out on.  Expansions owned: [thing=55660]Dixit 2[/thing]; [thing=92828]Dixit Odyssey[/thing],7.0
136052,21763,"Love the concept and the theme.  The game was a bit disappointing at first play, but perhaps I was expecting too much.  I definitely like it, just not as much as I thought I would.  Will definitely play it again though.  Good replay value.",7.0
167198,14105,"Great game. Similar to M'44, but a couple of nicer additions. You don't need all three (M'44, C&C:A and Battlelore), since they all scratch the same itch. I would go with any of the latter two, since the system is more ""developed"" in them. Personnally I prefer C&C:A for more control and for the theme, but if you prefer a fantasy world, you may be better with Battlelore.",7.0
47153,475,"The sheer number of decisions and things to keep track of are impressive; and I like the core card playing aspect which encourages nasty games of chicken, the outcome (or avoidance) of which often determine the final winner. This game has 3 major paths to victory, and is fascinating in that one is best off choosing a strategic path from the start of the game, but some wiggle room is definitely necessary, and knowing when to pick your fights (and when to bow out) is critically important.  However, the game only plays at it's best (IMHO) with 4 players (3 allows auctions to go too cheaply, makes folding without playing a card to get that 3rd card to rebuild your hand almost unthinkable because of the smaller number of players, and makes linking too easy, while 5 makes linking nigh impossible, and thus makes the game overly elephant and princess card based). A solid game, but the best at 4 scale make it a very occasional play for me. I used to own this, but ultimately had to let it go because of this requirement. If I was rating this purely on the 4 scale it would pretty easily roll in at 8, but I think both 3 and 5 are lacklustre, and mean that I generally avoid playing this game, so I have to knock it down to 7 overall.",7.0

39477,158899,"[b]BGG Auction - Christmas 2015[/b] Very wacky game reminiscent to the old Wild West films.  All the players are bandits running though and on top of the train trying to pick up loot and avoid the sheriff.  During the game you can shoot other players with gives then one of your bullet cards to clog up their deck.  You can punch someone, which makes them drop some loot and move into/onto the next train car.  It is very much like a comedy of errors during the game.  Highly entertaining.",7.0

He gets the mechanics right away, but the strategy/tactics take much longer. I think this is going to be true for me as well! This game appears as though it will take many plays before the tactical decisions begin to sink in. Strategically it's somewhat straight forward. Great game. I fear, however, with the wrong players it can be a paralysis nightmare. Played again with 4 players. A better game with four! More conflict.",8.0
